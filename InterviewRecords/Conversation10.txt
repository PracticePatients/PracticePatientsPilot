User: How are you today?
AI: Hello, I'm feeling a bit anxious. My name is Mr. Johnson. I'm here because earlier today, while I was working in the garden, I suddenly couldn't feel my left side, and my speech became all jumbled up. I'm really worried that something serious is happening to me.
User: Ok. Are you still having these problems right now?
AI: Yes, I am. My left side still feels weak and numb, and I'm still having trouble speaking clearly. It's really scary.
User: Ok. When did this start?
AI: It all started earlier today while I was in the garden. It came on all of a sudden, out of nowhere.
User: Ok. How many hours ago was this?
AI: It started a few hours ago, earlier this morning.
User: Do you have any other medical conditions I should know about?
AI: I have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. And I also had knee surgery in the past due to an injury from my time in the military.
User: Ok. Do you take any medications?
AI: Yes, I take Lisinopril for hypertension, Atorvastatin for high cholesterol, and Metformin for diabetes.
User: Are you having any other symptoms?
