User: hello what brings you in today?
AI: Hi, my name is Sofia. I'm here today because I've been experiencing these strange episodes where my arms and legs feel weak and tingly. Sometimes I have trouble walking, and it's really starting to worry me.
User: wow that sounds scary! when did these episodes start, and what were you doing when you first noticed them?
AI: The symptoms started about a year ago. Initially, I noticed them during periods of stress or fatigue. It was quite alarming when it first happened, especially because I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary at the time.
User: are these episodes intermittent, or constant? what made you come in today?
AI: The episodes are intermittent; they tend to occur unpredictably but worsen with stress or overexertion. I decided to come in today because these symptoms have been persistent for the past year, with intermittent flare-ups, and they've been interfering with my daily activities and causing me distress.
User: does anything make it better?
AI: Rest and relaxation tend to help alleviate the symptoms. Avoiding triggers like stress and overheating also make a difference.

User: do you have any headaches, visual changes, confusion
AI: No, I haven't experienced any headaches, visual changes, or confusion along with my symptoms of weakness and tingling in my arms and legs.
